# Employee
 This Java code defines an `Employee` class to represent employees in a company.

Some key things:

- It has properties to store data about an employee:
  - age 
  - number of holiday days entitled
  - name
  - payscale
- A constructor to create a new employee by passing in name and age
- Getter methods to retrieve the employee data 
- Setter methods to update the name and holiday days
- A `promote()` method to increase the payscale when an employee is promoted
- An `increaseAge()` method to increment the age
- It has `emp1` and `emp2` variables to store Employee objects
- A `swap()` method to swap `emp1` and `emp2` by using a temporary third employee object

So in summary, this `Employee` class encapsulates all the data and behaviors related to an employee - like name, age, holidays, promotion etc.

The class allows creating employee objects and manipulating their data easily. Key behaviors like promote and swap employees are also possible through methods defined in this class.
